## GPIO Pins: Your Rainbow's Atmosphere

Before making a rainbow, you must understand what powers and controls your rainbow. Because your rainbow is powered by the Raspberry Pi, you will be using the Pi's GPIO Pins to control your rainbow.

**GPIO** is an acronym for **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput/**O**utput.

**GPIO Pins** allow you to send and receive on/off signals to and from electronic components such as LEDs, motors, buttons and buzzers.

A Raspberry Pi has 26 GPIO pins. If you look at the Raspberry Pi with the USB ports facing towards you, this is the layout:
