## Buzzer Game Challenge

For this challenge, you will learn how to connect a buzzer to your raspberry pi and then your challenge is to replace one of the LEDs with a buzzer noise.

Follow the instructions below to connect your buzzer. Because you already have LEDs and a button, you will place your buzzer buzzer wherever there is room, and use a **GPIO** that is free.
