## Make a Unicorn Dance to your Rainbow

In this step, you will program a unicorn to dance in Scratch to the rhythm of your rainbow.
You will use a button to program your rainbow and dancing unicorn.

+ Either (1) change to the scratch unicorn sprite; (2) upload a unicorn sprite from somewhere else, or; (3) draw your own unicorn sprite in Scratch or another program (like the lovely green unicorn on the right):

| (1) Scratch Sprite:                          | (2) Upload your own:                         | (3) Draw your own:                           |
