## Introduction

Make a unicorn dance to your own LED rainbow.

### What you will make

In this resource, you will create your own rainbow which will be powered by the raspberry pi. You will use Scratch to connect the rainbow to a unicorn sprite, and then use programming to make the unicorn dance to the rhythm of the rainbow.

Here are two animations which show what your dancing unicorn and rainbow might look like:

<video width="560" height="315" controls>
<source src="resources/Screencast.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag, try FireFox or Chrome
</video>

Once you have trained your unicorn to dance to your rainbow, you can learn how to use the rainbow to make the unicorn do tricks or play a game.
