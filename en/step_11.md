## Buzzer Challenge

For this challenge, you will learn how to connect a buzzer to your raspberry pi and then your challenge is to replace one of the LEDs with a buzzer noise.

+ Connect the buzzer to your raspberry pi

Follow the instructions below to connect your buzzer. Because you already have LEDs and a button, you will place your buzzer wherever there is room, and use a **GPIO** that is free. Instead of **GPIO 17** like below, use **any free GPIO** .
