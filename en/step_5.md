## Test Your Circuit in Scratch

You will now connect your circuit and base rainbow colour to Scratch so you can use Scratch programming to control the LED.

+ In the last step, you connected your LED to GPIO 3V3. This is the pin to connect to if you are testing your LED. You now need to connect your LED to a pin you can control with Scratch (GPIO 17, for example).

+ Follow the instructions below to control your LED with Scratch.
