## Test Your Circuit in Scratch

You will now connect your circuit and base rainbow colour to Scratch so you can use Scratch programming to control the LED.

+ In the last step, you connected your LED to the 3.3V GPIO pin. This is the pin to connect to if you are testing your LED. You now need to connect your LED to a pin you can control with Scratch (GP17, for example).

+ Follow the instructions below to control your LED with Scratch.

+ To practice controlling your LED, complete the following challenges:
1) On an event, make your LED go on for 2 seconds and then off
2) On an event, make your LED go on for 2 seconds and then off for 2 seconds
3) On an event, make your LED blink on and off repeatedly
4) Make your LED blink faster
