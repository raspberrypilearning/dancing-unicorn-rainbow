## Control your rainbow circuit

When your whole rainbow is set up, you can control how it is lit. For a little practice of controlling one LED, use Scratch to do the following:

--- task ---
When you press the <kbd>P</kbd> key, make the LED turn on for two seconds and then turn off.
--- /task ---

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
Look in the `Control`{:class="block3control"} blocks section.

```
--- /hint ---

```blocks3
