## Build Your Rainbow

You are now ready to create an awesome rainbow! In this step, you will assemble your rainbow and program the LEDs to blink in a rainbow pattern.

+ Find all the LEDs you are going to use and make sure you also have the same amount of jumper wires and resistors

+ Rearrange the circuit you already have to make room for other colours of the rainbow. Leave space on the breadboard for a button.

Because we will have 3 or more LEDs on our breadboard, if you have ground wires for
