## Build your rainbow

In this step, you will assemble your rainbow and program its LEDs to blink in a rainbow pattern.

--- task ---
Find all the LEDs you are going to use, and make sure you also have the right number of jumper wires and resistors (one each per LED).
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Rearrange the circuit you already have to make room for the other colours of your rainbow.
--- /task ---

### Ground the rainbow

--- task ---
So that your rainbow shines brightly and is not covered by too many jumper wires, all LEDs should share one **Ground (GND)** pin. You can do set them up like this by rearranging your components on the breadboard a little.

The breadboard looks like this inside:

To ground the whole rainbow with one jumper wire:
--- /task ---


--- task ---
Connect the jumper wire attached to **GND** to a breadboard **rail**
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Make sure resistors connect to the same rail as the **GND** jumper wire and to the same **bar** as the LED they belong to:

### Complete the rainbow

--- task ---
Add the rest of your LEDs, jumper wires, and resistors to the breadboard in a colour arrangement of your choice. Make sure to leave room for a button at the end.
--- /task ---

If you are using many different colours, it might help to match the colour of the jumper wires to your LEDs.

Your rainbow should look similar to this one:
